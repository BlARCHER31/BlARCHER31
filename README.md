Hello, My name is Blake Archer. I am a self taught Software Developer. I began this journey in March of 2020.

I started with the fundamentals of coding through learning the basics of Python. After that I turned my attention towards 
HTML/CSS. After a comfortable understanding of the two I then began a deep dive of JavaScript. JavaScript has been my primary 
focus ever since. Through JavaScript I have grasped a firm understanding of the backend with NodeJS, and the frontend with React.

I have a passion and drive for software development that keeps me growing and learning new things I never thought possible.
I can't wait to be able to put these skills to professional use and continue to learn and grow as a developer.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Blake Archer
