Hello, My name is Blake Archer. I am a self taught Software Developer. I began this journey in March of 2020.

I started by learning the fundamentals of coding through learning the basics Python. After that I turned my attention to 
HTML/CSS. After a comfortable understanding of the two I then began learning JavaScript. JavaScript has been the main language I 
have invested my time in learning. Through JavaScript I have grasped a firm understanding of the backend with NodeJS.
I am currently working on the front-end with React. 

It is something I discovered fairly recently in
the grand scheme of things, but nonetheless I developed a passion for making mistakes, hitting road blocks, and learning from them.

I can't wait to be able to put these skills to professional use and continue to learn and grow as a developer.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Blake Archer
